SCENE 2: “Disaster!”
The Second to Last Car of the Mustachio Express (Business Class)

POINT A: “Meet Stanislov”

INGA enters BUSINESS CLASS from HOUSE RIGHT. We now see FRIEDRICK HURTMAN in a new disguise in a seat HOUSE CENTER. The GUARDS are standing at HOUSE LEFT.

The camera pans to the FAR LEFT where STANISLOV is signing autographs or something. The camera pans back to INGA.

INGA: I must speak with him!

POINT B: “No Groupies!”

INGA attempts to approach STANISLOV. MORITZ and MIKHAIL move up to her to stop her from reaching STANISLOV.

MORITZ: Authorized personnel only!
MIKHAIL: No disallowed persons!
MORITZ: You are not authorized!
MIKHAIL: Can’t go through!
INGA: But I MUST speak to Stanislov!
MORITZ: Stanislov is very busy. You will not see him.
MIKHAIL: Off limits!

From now on, whenever INGA attempts to approach STANISLOV the conversation will be:
MORITZ: Still trying to get by, hmm?
MIKHAIL: No entry!

POINT C: “A Convenient Opening”

INGA passes by a CONVENIENT AIR DUCT OPENING ROUGHLY THE SIZE OF A HAMSTER BALL on her way back from speaking with the GUARDS. She inspects it. The CAMERA pans LEFT to the OTHER OPENING over STANISLOV.

INGA: Hmmm…

Shortly after, the HAMSTER BALL rolls into BUSINESS CLASS, wobbles around a bit, and rolls back into ECONOMY CLASS. If INGA goes to ECONOMY CLASS, the ball is rolling around on the floor.

POINT D: “Candy from a Baby”

Upon CLICKING the HAMSTER BALL, the player may SET POTATO FREE. The EMPTY HAMSTER BALL passes into the INVENTORY.

Upon dragging the PEN onto the PAD OF PAPER in the inventory, INGA writes a NOTE TO STANISLOV:

INGA: Dear Mr. Slavinsky, I have been following your work for the past few years and would be delighted if you would have tea with me to discuss the utsmer-yezzish form. Shall we? Inga Borga

There is now a NOTE TO STANISLOV in the inventory. Upon dragging the NOTE TO STANISLOV onto the EMPTY HAMSTER BALL, INGA places the NOTE TO STANISLOV in the EMPTY HAMSTER BALL producing a NOTE DELIVERY SYSTEM.

Upon dragging the NOTE DELIVERY SYSTEM to the CONVENIENT AIR DUCT OPENING ROUGHLY THE SIZE OF A HAMSTER BALL, INGA puts the HAMSTER BALL into the DUCT and it rolls past the GUARDS. It exits the other end of the duct and drops on STANISLOV’s head. He reads the NOTE TO STANISLOV. He looks over at INGA and SAPPY MUSIC plays.

STANISLOV sends a note to MORITZ, who beckons to INGA.

MORITZ: Stanislov will see you now.

INGA moves toward STANISLOV.

The lights go out.

STANISLOV screams.

The lights flicker. FRIEDRICK HURTMAN is seen dragging a SACK out to the left. The lights go out. There are sounds of a fight.

The lights come on. MORITZ and MIKHAIL are unconscious on the floor. The pants of both have been stolen.
