INGA is seen sitting in a CHAIR at HOUSE RIGHT. She is reading a MAGAZINE. GREG BRIGGS is three seats in front of her. FRIEDRICK HURTMAN is several seats in front of him, OFFSCREEN. Past him are the TOURISTS, the MOB, and SHAMUS. Most of the remaining seats are filled by COMMUTERS. Somewhere on the wall there is a THERMOSTAT.

Enter LEVITY WHISK from HOUSE LEFT. She is pushing a CART.

LEVITY stops every three seats and asks groups of COMMUTERS if they would like anything to eat or drink. The COMMUTERS do not respond.

LEVITY stops next to INGA.

LEVITY: Excuse me miss, would you like anything to eat or drink?

INGA: Yes please! I’ll have some Tasty Nuts and a lemonade.

LEVITY: That'll be five Space Bucks.

INGA hands LEVITY the SPACE BUCKS.

LEVITY rummages in her cart and produces TASTY NUTS. She hands them to INGA, who tucks them in her PURSE. The TASTY NUTS appear in the INVENTORY.
LEVITY rummages in her cart and produces LEMONADE. She hands the LEMONADE to INGA, who drinks it and puts the EMPTY CUP in her PURSE. The CUP appears in the INVENTORY.

LEVITY: Oh, I see you’re reading “Motherland Poems Monthly!”
INGA: Yes, I just love Stanislov Slavinsky’s series about comets this month! I’m traveling now to see him read in [Space France].
LEVITY: Lucky woman! I love Stanislov’s work as well.
LEVITY: Enjoy your Tasty Nuts!

LEVITY continues on her rounds. When she exits at HOUSE LEFT or HOUSE RIGHT, she comes back after 60 seconds.

	(Funny commentary about fashion styles)

Bum a cig:

	FRAN: Pssh. Like, no. You like totally don’t understand our generation.
	LIAM: Ja. I bet you haffen’t even heard of the band Rampant Lizards.
	AMANDA: Or Lieutenant McSpazz’s Shoelace Extravaganza.
	FRAN: Or the best band ever, Deep Couch.
	LIAM: Ja. They broke up like, fifty years ago.
	AMANDA: Sold thirteen records and played one show.
	FRAN: (Holding up a vinyl disc) THIS IS EIN ORIGINAL RECORD.
	
	INGA: You are all so young…
	INGA: Too young to remember how Deep Couch were when they were formed.
	The HIPSTERS’ eyes all bug out
	INGA: You see, the members of Deep Couch were my cousins. Musical geniuses, all of them.
	INGA: My uncle converted his textile factory to produce records, but it burned down after only 13 were made.
	INGA: Such a pity that after their first show, the lead singer married a Hawaiian dancer and moved away.

SHAMUS puts POTATO on the floor and ravages the BOWL OF BEAN SOUP. POTATO starts to run around and can be picked up when clicked while near INGA.
