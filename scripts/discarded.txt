Bum a cig:

	FRAN: Pssh. Like, no. You like totally don’t understand our generation.
	LIAM: Ja. I bet you haffen’t even heard of the band Rampant Lizards.
	AMANDA: Or Lieutenant McSpazz’s Shoelace Extravaganza.
	FRAN: Or the best band ever, Deep Couch.

	AMANDA: Sold thirteen records and played one show.
	FRAN: (Holding up a vinyl disc) THIS IS EIN ORIGINAL RECORD.
	
	INGA: You are all so young…
	INGA: Too young to remember how Deep Couch were when they were formed.

	INGA: You see, the members of Deep Couch were my cousins. Musical geniuses, all of them.
	INGA: My uncle converted his textile factory to produce records, but it burned down after only 13 were made.
	INGA: Such a pity that after their first show, the lead singer married a Hawaiian dancer and moved away.
